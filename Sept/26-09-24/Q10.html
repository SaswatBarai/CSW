	<b><em>S = V<sub>1</sub> + 1/2at<sup>2n<sup></em></b>

	<p>
        The equation <b><em>S = V<sub>1</sub> + 1/2at<sup>2n<sup></em></b> describes the displacement (S) of an object under constant acceleration (a) from an initial velocity (V1).This equation is a modification of the more widely known equation <b><em>D = V<sub>1</sub> + 1/2at<sup>2n<sup></em></b>, which describes distance (D) instead of displacement.
    </p>
    <h3>Meaning of all variables: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>V1: Initial velocity of the object at the starting point.</li>
        <li>a: Constant acceleration applied to the object.</li>
        <li>t: Time elapsed since the initial velocity</li>
        <li>n: Not applicable in this equation, as it seems to be a mistake or an incomplete notation. The correct equation is <b><em>S = V<sub>1</sub> + 1/2at<sup>2n<sup></em></b>, without the ‘n’ term.</li>
    </ul>
